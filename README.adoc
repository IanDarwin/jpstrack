= jpstrack

JpsTrack is a Map Maker application,
a GPX-tracking GPS App for creating OpenStreetMap or Google Earth data
This program is not a navigation app for getting from point a to point B.

== History

I wrote the first version of jpsTrack in 2007 as a Java SE application.
A few years after that - starting in 2010 - I wrote an Android user interface in Java.

This is an all-new implementation in Flutter, so it will be able to run
on both Android and iOS.
