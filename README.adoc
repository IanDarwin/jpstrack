= jpstrack

A GPX-tracking GPS App for creating OpenStreetMap or Google Earth data

== History

I wrote the first version of jpsTrack years ago as a Java SE application.
Some years after that I wrote an Android user interface for it.

This is an all-new implementation in Flutter, so it will be able to run
on at least Android and iOS.
